## How to contribute to ipydeps

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/nbgallery/ipydeps/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/nbgallery/ipydeps/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Run tox to make sure current tests still pass.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please ensure the code conforms to the style of the file(s) being patched.  If a new Python file is being contributed, then just follow PEP 8.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Unsolicited changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/nbgallery/ipydeps/issues/new) for further discussion on what you intend to add/change.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Please try Googling first.

* Find one of the major contributors via the [commit log](https://github.com/nbgallery/ipydeps/commits/master) and contact them to get pointed in the right direction.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* If contributing to existing documentation, submit a pull request with the patch.

* If you have a long example of how you did something, consider writing up a blog post.  Submit an issue with the link to your post and we may link to it from the official docs.

Thanks!
